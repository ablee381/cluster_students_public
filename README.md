# cluster_students_public
Public code to cluster students by test results. Includes fake test results as demonstration

The code can be run on the command line with the following command

python main.py result_sheet test_pdf

The code requires an API key to MathPix. For those who do not have such an API key, I have prepared a demo version. The results are generated into the demo folder by running

python demo_run.py
